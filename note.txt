javascript makes our website functional and interactive 
the users cant see javascript codes , its only for communication between the computer and the developer and or server
so we can typically see javascript codes in the console of ANY browser

to write our js codes we can do it in 3 ways 
we have inline javascript - <button onclick="fikayo()">click me </button> 
 we hve internal javascript - <script > 
 </script>

 we have external javascript - we llink a javascript file to our html at the bottom of the html file 

 to view our javascript code or to run our javascript code we use - console.log()
 
 in js we can do calculations from simple ones to complex calculations and to do that we make use of operators

 so we can do additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions in js 
 + - / *

data types in javascript 
we have several types
we have STRINGS - we write texts in javascript in strings 
we have NUMBERS - 10 20 ( we dont put numbes in strings)
we have BOOLEANS - true and false 
we have arrays
we have dictionary 
we have undefined 
we have null - 0

NAMING VARIABLES 
we have 3 ways of naming VARIABLES - let , var , const 

let - the variable we are naming can be changed 
var - the variable we are naming can be changed
const - the variable cant be changed - constant 

we use camelcase to write variable names


example on calculations

we go to a mallam shop to buy things and we bought 5 milo, 8 sardine, 9 eggs and 1 kopiko, we initially took 20000 to buy everything, calculate total price and show the change
1 milo - 2000
1 sardine - 200
1 egg - 300
1 kopiko - 20

so we can make alerts and give prompts using javascript
to make an alert - alert("")
to give a prompt - prompt("")

we can now start using 
< - less than
> - greater than
<= - less or equals
>= - greater or equals to
&& - and 
|| - or 
== - equals to ( check if value is the same)
=== - equals to ( checks if value and data type are the same)

IF statements
IF else statements ( < , > , <= , >=, && , || )
